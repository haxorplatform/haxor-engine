# Haxor Engine

Combine the power of HaXe language and WebGL to allow the development of high 
quality rich applications for the next generation browsers.

# Get Started

1) Install Haxor with the command 'haxelib install haxor' 
2) If you are starting, examples are in the [haxor_library] bitbucket. 
   You can download the zip from there. 
3) Get the project template here [http://goo.gl/KNtRaC] or in [haxor_library] 
4) Build the project and check your browser console.log

There is some info on the 'Application' class workflow.


# Considerations

This version is a prototype of the future 1.0 version.
Code conventions, naming of classes/methods/variables will change a lot during this phase.
Beware!!  
Each new version has a great probability of breaking the last one.  
Expect things to blow anytime and everywhere!  
Use [haxor_library] repository to grab assets to quickly test features or see examples.

Enjoy the ride :)
