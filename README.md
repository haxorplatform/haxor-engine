Combine the power of HaXe language and WebGL to allow the development of high 
quality rich applications for the next generation browsers.

# Get Started

Follow the instructions on the site [http://haxor.thelaborat.org/download.html]

# Considerations

This version is a prototype of the future 1.0 version.  
Code conventions, naming of classes/methods/variables will change a lot during this phase.  
Beware!!  
Each new version has a great probability of breaking the last one.  
Expect things to blow anytime and everywhere!  
Use [haxor_library] repository to grab assets to quickly test features or see examples.  
  
Enjoy the ride :)
